# Active Context

## Current Work
Working on getting heart rate readings from the MAX30102 sensor to display on the frontend.

## Recent Changes
1. Attempted firmware modifications:
   - Increased LED brightness
   - Adjusted sampling configuration
   - Added debug output
   - Added sensor presence detection

2. Python script updates:
   - Added WebSocket server
   - Implemented serial data collection
   - Created HTTP server for frontend

## Current Issues
1. No readings when sensor is placed on skin
2. Lack of debug output to diagnose problems
3. Unclear if sensor initialization is successful

## Next Steps
1. Add comprehensive debug logging to firmware:
   - Sensor initialization status
   - Raw sensor data values
   - LED current settings
   - Sample rate configuration

2. Verify sensor hardware connection:
   - I2C communication
   - Power supply voltage
   - LED current settings

3. Improve Python script:
   - Add raw data logging
   - Implement better error handling
   - Add connection status indicators

4. Enhance frontend:
   - Add connection status display
   - Show raw sensor values
   - Implement debug view
